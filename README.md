selection sort algorith works by selecting the minimum value in a list and swap them from smaller number to bigger number.

for this we need nested for loop
in the firs for loop we start variable i from zero to the number of length of array and we increase that i,
in line 4 we assume we assume that the minimum number is equal to i i is start with 0 so we assume that the first number of array is equal to minimum number.

in the second foor loop we add variable of j which start from i+1we compare tu number and there is noo need to compare array number in the same index of array.

in the if condition we compare array with index number of j and minimum number. if minimum number is greater than then number in index of j then minimum number will be j
if it is not the second loop will increase up to find the smalles number.
 if the smallest number found we will swap it with the code in line 11 and the first loop will increrase and find the 2. smammlest number. and after all we will swapp all and log the array.

 here is the example think we have array which is [4, 7 ,3 ,12]
 the first loop will assume that the first number inde array whic is 4 is smallest number.
 second loop will compare 2. number in de array whis is 7 with the for if 4 is smaller than 7 the second loop will increase and look the 3. number if the secon number is smaller than 4 which is 3 then the minimum number will be 3 and increase loop to 4 and look at the last number inthe array. asyou can see we 12 is bigger than 3 so the minimum number still 3 so we found the smallest number after that we need to second smallest number for this we need to increase the first loop and so on.
